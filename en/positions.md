# Positions

As *de-RSE e.V. - Society for Research Software*, we develop and take positions on different aspects of research software, and on topics that affect the people, groups, structures and institutions involved in research software. In doing so, we take the viewpoint of a heterogeneous community, which includes Research Software Engineers across the spectrum of roles and concepts, and represent them in the public discourse.

Our positions are developed in [open community processes](#development-process), which are actively shaped by our members. This process model includes open calls for collaboration, collaborative development, and open review processes upon which decisions are based.

When members of de-RSE e.V. represent the Society in public, they take the accepted positions in relevant discourse.
